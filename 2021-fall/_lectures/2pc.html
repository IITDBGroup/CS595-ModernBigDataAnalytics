## Motivation - Distributed Transaction Processing

- Recall that databases guarantee that the ACID properties for transactions are maintained
- **Atomicity**: either all or none of the operations of a transaction are executed
- **Consistency**: if the database is initially in a consistent state, then it is consistent after the execution of every transaction
- **Isolation**: transactions running concurrently behave as if they were running sequentially
- **Durability**: changes made by committed transactions are never lost

## Motivation - Distributed Transaction Processing

- Textbook logging & recovery mechanisms ([Aries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_Recovery_and_Isolation_Exploiting_Semantics)) can be employed to ensure atomicity on a single node database system
- How to ensure atomicity in a distributed setting?
  - Need nodes to agree on whether to abort of commit a transaction (under failures)
  - => We need a consensus protocol for atomicity!
  - We need an **atomic commit protocol (ACP)**

## States of nodes

- Wrt. a single transaction, nodes are in either of one states:
  - **working**: still running the transaction
  - **prepared**: finished the transaction and prepared to commit
  - **committed**: transaction is committed
  - **aborted**: transaction is aborted
- Valid transitions between states are shown on the next slide

## Two Phase Commit (2PC)

- An atomic commit protocol
- Uses a **single coordinator** (different transactions may use different coordinators)
- All other nodes in the cluster (involved in the transaction) are **participants**
- Consists of two phases:
  - **Voting phase**:
    - Coordinator informs participants to prepare the commit of the transaction
    - Participants inform the coordinator of their vote (commit or abort).
    - Once the coordinator has received votes from all participants it makes
  - **Decision phase**:
    - Coordinator informs participants about the decision (commit if all participants voted commit, otherwise abort)
    - Participants acknowledge the receipt of the decision to the coordinator
    - Once the Coordinator has received acknowledgments from all participants the transaction is aborted / committed

## Dealing with Failures

- **All nodes write decisions to a stable storage (WAL) before sending their decision**
  - Participants write their commit decision to WAL before sending it to coordinator
  - Coordinator writes the decision for the transaction to WAL before sending it to participants
  - Participants write the commit decision they receive from the coordinator to WAL
  - Coordinate writes an end record after receiving acknowledgments from all participants

## Failure Detection and Recovery

- Failures are detected through **time-outs**
