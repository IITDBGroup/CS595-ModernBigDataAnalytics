# 2. Distributed Storage
## LSM-Trees
  </textarea>

## Motivation

- We will discuss an index structure called **LSM-trees**
- This index structure is **write optimized**, i.e., provides high write throughput
- **range-query performance** is sacrificed to some degree
- LSM-trees are used in most implementations of key-value stores

## The History of LSM

- LSM-tree were first proposed by O'Neil et al. in the 90s as a write-optimized index structure

> The log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree). Patrick O'Neil, Edward Cheng, Dieter Gawlick, Elizabeth O'Neil. Acta Informatica, 1996.

- With the emergence of key-value stores (NoSQL) databases in the later 2000s, LSM-trees became widely deployed in real systems and optimizations were studied intensively in academia

## LSM-trees

- An LSM-tree is a data structure that indexes **key-value pairs**
- **Supported operations**
  - **insert** `(key, value)` - insert a new key-value pair into the index
  - **update** `(key, value)` - set the value of `key` to be `value`
  - **point query** `key` - find the value `value` associated with `key` (or indicate that `key` does not exist in the index)
  - **range query** `[k1,k2]` - return all key-value pairs `(k,v)` such that $k \in [k1,k2]$
  - **delete** `key` - delete `key` from the index

## LSM-tree Concepts

- LSM-tree are **write-optimized**
- LSM-tree use **out-of-place update**
  - instead of updating values of existing keys in-place, LSM-trees create a new entry on updates
- LSM-trees consist of multiple **components**
  - each component is some regular index structure (we discuss two typical choices in the following)
  - not all components have to use the same type of index structure

## LSM-tree Structure

- LSM-trees organize components into **levels**
  - the component(s) at the lowest level $L_0$ live in memory
    - this is sometimes called a **memtable**
    - the **memtable** is subject to a size limit $\mathcal{S}$
  - components at lower levels are stored on disk and are **immutable**
  - components at level $L_{i+1}$ are a factor $T$ (**size ratio**) times larger than components at level $L_i$
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Leveling Merge Policy

- Each level has a single component
- When a component at level $l$ reaches its size limit $\mathcal{S} \cdot T^{l}$, it is merged into the component at level $l+1$ creating a new component at level $l+1$ that replaces the old component at level $l+1$
- A merge from level $l$ to level $l+1$ may cause the component at level $l+1$ to also overflow (reach its size limit)
  - that is a merge may trigger further merges at lower levels
- A common size ratio is $T=10$, i.e., the size limit for the component at level $l+1$ is $10$ times the size limit for the component at level $l$
</textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## LSM-tree Modification Operations

- **memtable**
  - all insert/update/delete operations are applied to the memtable
  - when the **memtable** is full, it is merged into the disk-resident component at level `L1` and **new** empty memtable is created
- **disk components**
  - components at level $l > 0$ are stored on disk
  - these components are immutable, i.e., not updated in place
  - when such a component is full, it is merged into the component at the next level
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Existence of Keys at Multiple Levels

- A key $k$ may exist in more than one component with different values
- This happens when a component containing the key is merged into the next level
- Because merging happens in increasing order of levels the following invariant holds:
  - If a key exists at levels $l$ and $l' > l$ then the key-value pair at level $l$ is newer than the one on level $l'$
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Merging components

- To merge a component $C_i$ at level $i$ into the component $C_{i+1}$ at level $i+1$
- We scan through both $C_i$ and $C_{i+1}$ sorted by keys and output a merged component $C_{new}$
  - for keys that appear in both components we use the value from $C_{i}$ because it is guaranteed to be newer (see previous slide)
- This is essentially the merge phase of an external merge sort!

<textarea data-template>
## LSM-tree Inserts
- `Insert(k,v)`
  - to insert `k:v`, insert it into the memtable
  - how this works precisely depends on the type of index used as a memtable
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Insert / Update Example

- Let's consider $T=2$ and $\mathcal{S} = 2$ (up to two entries in the memtable)
- In the next slide we are inserting a new key-value pair `k3:v9` causing the memtable to exceed its size limit (2) which results in :
  - a new memtable being created
  - the current memtable gets merged with the current component at level `L1` to form the new component at level `L1`

## Look-up Example

- On the next slide we are searching for `k1`
- The search starts at level `L0` and continues until either
  - we have not found the key at the lowest level => the key is not in the index
  - we have found the key => return the value
- This always returns the latest version of the key

## LSM-Trees Deletion

- deleting a key just from the memtable is not enough, because previous versions of the key may still exist at lower levels
- **solution**: insert the key with a **tombstone**, a special value that indicates that the key has been deleted
- changes to look-up: when finding a tombstone the search finishes and
- changes to merging: merging a tombstone for key $k$ from $Ci$ with a key from $C_{i+1}$ results in $k$ to be excluded from the merged component
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Delete Example

- assume $S = 3$ (up to three entries in the memtable)
- delete key `k3` (exists in `L1`) and `k2` (not in `L0`)
- instead of deleting `k3` and doing nothing about `k2` (which already does not exist in the memtable) we have to insert both with a tombstone

## Requirements for Indexes for Components

- in principle any index structures for range-based access can be used to implement components of LSM-tree
- the memtable and disk components have different access patterns
  - the memtable has mostly point look-ups and in-place updates and once in a while sorted access to all its entries (during merge)
  - the disk-resident components only require fast look-up and sorted access to all entries during merge
- one advantage of LSM is that we can choose different data structures for the memtable and disk-based components
</textarea>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Index Structures for Memtables

- Since memtables only live in memory, we are not restricted to use index structures that can operate efficiently from secondary storage
  - e.g., skip-lists
- For disk components we can exploit the immutability of the data
  - storing the data sorted on key with some additional lightweight index is feasible
  - common choices are SSTables (introduced next) and B-trees
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## SSTables

- An SSTable stores a set of key value pairs sorted on disk
  - key-value pairs are stored on blocks that are of a size that is a multiple of the disk block size
- In addition the SSTable contains a lightweight index which records which blocks store which range of keys
  - this is used to speed up look-ups (both point and range)
  - this index is small enough to be kept in memory

## Bloom Filters

- A bloom filter is an over-approximation of a set
- It supports two operations:
  - `insert(e)`: inserts the element $e$ into the bloom filter
  - `contains(e)`: determines whether element $e$ is in the bloom filter
- Given any set of values $\mathcal{S} = \{ e_1, \ldots, e_n \}$ inserted into a bloom filter:
  - `contains(e)` for $e \in \mathcal{S}$ is guaranteed to return true **(no false negatives)**
  - `contains(e)` for $e \not\in \mathcal{S}$ returns true with a probability $\epsilon$ (called the **false positive rate**) and false otherwise **(false positives are possible)**
</textarea>
</section>

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## How do Bloom Filters Work?

- A bloom filter consists of a bit array $B$ of $m$ bits uses $k$ hash functions $h_1, \ldots, h_k$
- initially, all bits of the bloom filter are set to $0$
- `insert(B,e)`
  - for each $i \in [1,k]$ set $B[h_i(e)] = 1$
- `contains(B,e)`
  - return true if $\bigwedge_{i=1}{^k} B[h_i(e)]$, and false otherwise

<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Bloom Filter Example

- Consider $k = 2$ and $m = 6$
  - $h_1(x) = x+1 % 6$
  - $h_2(x) = x\cdot 2 % 6$

## Optimizing Bloom Filters

- The $m$ and $k$ parameters of a bloom filter can be chosen to achieve a particular false positive rate $\epsilon$ for a given number of elements $n$ inserted into the filter
  - increasing $m$ reduces $\epsilon$, but increases the storage requirements of the bloom filter
  - increasing $k$ reduces $\epsilon$, but increases the computational cost of the `contains` and  `insert` operations
- it shown that the optimal number of bits per element is $m \simeq -1.44 \log_2 \epsilon$

## Using Bloom Filters to Speed-up Reads in LSM-trees

- We can maintain for each component a bloom filter that over-approximates the keys stored in the component
  - These are typically small enough to live in memory
- To determine whether the component contains a key $k$
  - First check whether the bloom filter contains $k$
    - If no, then $k$ is guaranteed to not be in the component
    - Otherwise we proceed to search for $k$ in the component
- Assume bloom filters with a low false positive rate, e.g., 1%:
  - look-up in $\simeq 1$ times the look-up in a single component

## Leveled vs. Tiered Design

- The design we have discussed so far is called level strategy / design
- An alternative is the so-called
</textarea>
</section>


<section data-markdown>
<textarea data-template>
## Summary

- **LSM-trees** are write-optimized indexes used in many implementations of key-value stores
  - memtable + one or more disk components
  - Entries move over time from the memtable through the levels of disk components
- leveled vs. tiered strategy
- Writes are always sequential
  - merging of components is akin to the merge phase of external mergesort
- Reads may require examining multiple components
  - => reads are slower (solved by using bloom filters)
- Disk components are immutable
  - e.g., can be supported in append-only file systems like HDFS
