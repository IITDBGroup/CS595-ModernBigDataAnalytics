# Overview

In the project you will extend an existing Big Data system. Concrete project ideas will be posted at the beginning of the course.

## Organization & Dates

The first step will be for you to identify a project you want to work on. Some example project ideas are shown below. However, suggesting your own ideas is encouraged. Once you have selected a project, you should come up with a plan for implementing the project. You should then meet with the instructor to present your approach. The finished project is due at the end of the semester. You should write a short summary of what you done. The project code will be submitted through github. We will create a repository on github for each student. Furthermore, at the last day of class (**{{ site.data.course.due.project_presentation }}**), we will do short project presentations (5-10 minutes per project).

In summary, the timeline for the project is:

- Select a project: **{{ site.data.course.due.project_selection }}**
- Meet to discuss project design: **{{ site.data.course.due.project_design }}**
- Finish project implementation: **{{ site.data.course.due.project_presentation }}**
